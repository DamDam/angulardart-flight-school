This is a workshop developped for the AngularDart Flight School event in Nantes organized by the GDG.

The aim is to develop a sample of address book to show how powerful AngularDart is.

This workshop is divided in multiple steps, each step includes developments documented in this readme. If you have any trouble with 
one step, do not worry you can find the solution in the next step tag / branch. 

#Step 0 - Bootstrapping and Simple binding
The first thing we need to do is create the Dart file which is going to contains our main method required by Dart and include it in the index.html


to bootstrap AngularDart to start using it. As a reminder this is how we would have done it in JavaScript:
```JavaScript
angular.module('NgContacts', [])
```
